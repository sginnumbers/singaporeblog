<p>In 2014, the main Singapore newspaper reported that public hospitals were facing a ‘severe bed crunch’ and putting patients in ‘beds along corridors, with just curtains to give them privacy’ when demand spikes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Some citizens have voiced concerns about the number of hospital beds<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In this post, you will see how the number of hospital beds has <em>increased</em>, while the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people has <em>decreased</em>, over the years. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The downward trend in the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in Singapore is consistent with most OECD countries. Some possible reasons for this trend are given at the end.</p>

<h2>Total number of hospital beds in Singapore</h2>
<p>The total number of hospital beds in Singapore increased from 7,187 in 1960 to 12,505 in 2014, which is a 74% change. The chart below shows the number of private and public hospital beds for each year from 1960 to 2014<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<h2>Hospital beds per 1,000 people</h2>
<p>Singapore’s total population has changed over the years (<a href="https://numbers.sg/posts/the-number-of-citizens-permanent-residents-and-non-residents-in-singapore/">see previous blog post by clicking here</a>). We can take this into consideration by calculating how many hospital beds there are, on average, for every 1,000 people in Singapore. The chart below shows the number of private and public hospital beds per 1,000 people from 1960 to 2014.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The number of public hospital beds per 1,000 people declined from 4 in 1960 to 1.8 in 2014.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a slight increase in the number of private hospital beds per 1,000 people from 0.4 in 1960 to 0.5 in 2014.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>There is a downward trend in almost all countries, with some notable exceptions like Korea (KOR) and China (CHN).</p></li>

<h2>Reasons for decline in hospital beds per 1,000 people</h2>
<p>There are many possible reasons for a decreasing number of hospital beds per 1,000 people. This includes having a population that is increasing faster than the number of hospital beds being installed, as well as better medical technology and more services at the community level, both of which reduce the need for hospitalisation<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
