```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
## Load required libraries and data
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(MASS)
data(UScereal)
#UScereal
df <- UScereal #store cereal data into df
rm(UScereal) #remove this as it is now duplicate of df

## Problem: first column (brand) has no name, it is instead stored as a rowname
## Solution: bind dataframe with rownames + values as a column, then remove rownames, and rename first column
df <- cbind(rownames(df), df) 
rownames(df) <- NULL
df <- df %>%
  rename(brand = 'rownames(df)')

## Rename this brand name as it was too long
levels(df$brand)[levels(df$brand)=="Fruit & Fibre: Dates Walnuts and Oats"] <- "Fruit & Fibre" 
```

`r emo::ji('bar_chart')` Bar charts are one of the most common methods for displaying data. However, bar charts are not always created optimally. In this post, I'll share R and Python code that you can use to create accurate, informative and attractive bar charts easily. Specifically, sorting your bars when your data have no natural ordering, which I'll now explain.

## When to use bar charts^[For this section, I've adapted information from a highly-recommended book: _Freeman, J. V., Walters, S. J., Campbell, M. J. 2008. How to display data, British Medical Journal Books_.]

You can use bar charts when you have _categorical_ data, which refers to data that can be categorised into distinct groups. Eye colour, ethnicity, gender, social class, school grades (e.g. A--F) are examples of categorical data.

Categorical data can be further divided into whether they have a natural order or not. Eye colour, ethnicity and gender are examples of categorical data that have _no_ natural ordering. On the other hand, social class and school grades have natural ordering. Take school grades for example: an 'A' is better than a 'B', which is better than a 'C', and so on.

When categorical data have no natural ordering, they should be **ordered by size** (e.g. category occuring most often first, least often last) as this helps readers scan more information and spot patterns easier.

## Order your bar charts easily in R and Python

```{r include=FALSE}
#>`r emo::ji('warning')` _Although categorical data may be coded numerically, for example gender may be coded 1 for male and 2 for female, these codes have no intrinsic numerical value; it would be nonsense to calculate an average gender... or average social class of a sample_---Jenny Freeman, Stephen Walters and Michael Campbell (2008)^[Freeman, J. V., Walters, S. J., Campbell, M. J. 2008. How to display data, British Medical Journal Books.]

### Why code in both R and Python?
#R and Python are the two most common programming languages in data science. However, most people know one or the other language, and very few people use both languages according to surveys^[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/python-overtakes-r-leader-analytics-data-science.html]. This is a problem because data science teams often have a mix of R and Python users who will struggle to work efficiently together.
```

I will use the US cereal dataset to reproduce some charts from an [earlier blogpost on creating effective charts for a business audience](https://numbers.sg/posts/how-to-display-data-in-the-business-world/) that I wrote with my colleague, [Rachael Dottle](https://rachaeldottle.com/). 

I will first create a bar chart with default options, which automatically orders the categories alphabetically, then a bar chart ordered by size, where the bars are arranged in a descending order. A simple tweak in **ONE** line of code in both R and Python will produce a more attractive and informative chart.

In the code examples below, the data set will be called `cereal`. The bar chart will have the cereal brand on the horizontal axis and the calories per serving on the vertical axis (termed `brand` and `calories` respectively in the code examples below).

### R (using ggplot2)

```{r defaultbareg, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2) #the library you need
ggplot(data = cereal, 
       aes(x = brand, y = calories)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') 
```

```{r defaultbar, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = brand, y = calories)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  #make background white instead of grey with this line:
  theme_classic() +
  #rotate brand names on the x axis and remove gridlines:
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 7),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 9.5)) +
  labs(x = 'Cereal by brand',
       y = 'Calories per serving')
```

```{r orderbareg, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = cereal, 
       aes(x = reorder(brand, -calories), y = calories)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') 
```

```{r orderbar, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#Order brand by highest calories first
##use calories without minus sign to order by lowest calories first
  ggplot(data = df, aes(x = reorder(brand, -calories), y = calories)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity')  + 
  #make background white instead of grey with this line:
  theme_classic() +
  #rotate brand names on the x axis and remove gridlines:
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 7),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 9.5)) +
  labs(x = 'Cereal by brand',
       y = 'Calories per serving') 
```

#### What changed?

In the second line of `ggplot`, `x = brand` changed to `x = reorder(brand, -calories)`.

### Python (using seaborn)

```{r pydefault, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import seaborn as sns  #the library you need
sns.barplot(x = 'brand', y = 'calories', color='gray', 
            data = cereal)
```

```{r pyorder, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sns.barplot(x = 'brand', y = 'calories', color='gray', 
            data = cereal.sort_values('calories', ascending=False))
```

#### What changed?
In the second line of `sns.barplot`, `data = cereal` changed to `data = cereal.sort_values('calories', ascending=False)`.

## Summary
It is good practice to arrange your bar chart by how often the categories appear in your data---if the categories have _no_ natural order, e.g. eye colour, gender. The examples above show how this can be done easily in R _and_ Python by tweaking **ONE** line of code.
