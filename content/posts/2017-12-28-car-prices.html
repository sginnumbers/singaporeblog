<p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-ranked-worlds-most-expensive-city-again">Singapore is the most expensive place in the world to own a car, according to a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit</a>. Currently, buying a new Toyota Corolla would cost around SGD $100,000 (~USD $75,000), and you can only own it for 10 years. After 10 years, you have to deregister and dispose your car or buy a Certificate of Entitlement to continue using it for another 5 or 10 years.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Land Transport Authority of Singapore</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who wishes to register a new vehicle in Singapore must first obtain a Certificate of Entitlement (COE), in the appropriate vehicle category. A COE represents a right to vehicle ownership and use of the limited road space for 10 years… COEs are released through competitive bidding. There are 2 bidding exercises every month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When buying a new car, you have to obtain a COE <em>and</em> pay for the cost of the car. COEs are used together with a quota on the number of vehicles allowed on the roads to regulate the vehicle population growth<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Using data from the Singapore government’s open-data initiative<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, we can find out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much does a COE for a new car cost?</p></li>
<li><p>How many COEs are available?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The charts below show the cost of COEs for new cars in each bidding round every month, from January 2010 to August 2017. Each panel represents a different vehicle category.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-28-car-prices_files/figure-html/prices-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>The cost of COEs tended to increase initially and then decrease after 2013, although there were were rather large fluctuations. The fluctations tended to be smaller after 2016.</p>
<p>The cost of COEs tended to be similar across each bidding round, with some notable exceptions. For example, see Category B just after January 2016, where the COE price in round 1 was noticeably lower than in round 2.</p>
<p>Categories B and E tended to have very similar patterns. The price of COEs for new Category B and new Category E cars tended to be very similar in each month.</p>
<p>The charts below show the number of available COEs for cars in each bidding round every month, from January 2010 to August 2017. Each panel represents a different vehicle category.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-28-car-prices_files/figure-html/quota-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>For each category, the number of available COEs tended to be very similar in each bidding round, with a few exceptions. For example, see the red spike in Category E, between January and July 2016.</p>
<p>Across categories, the trend in the number of available COEs was different.</p>
<p>There is an interesting pattern in Category C, from 2014 onwards. There is a jump from April to May. From May to July, it stays constant. Then, it falls in August. This pattern is most noticeable in 2017.</p>
